Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Project status (2026-05-05)

**TabVision is mid-spec-adoption.** A new canonical specification at
`SPEC.md` (formerly `TAB_SPEC_UPDATE.md`) reframes the project as a Python
CLI with strict module boundaries. v0 (Electron + Flask, ~91.6% F1 on
11-clip set) is **frozen**; v1 (`tabvision/` package) is being built in
parallel under `refactor/v1`.

**Read these before any non-trivial change:**
- `SPEC.md` — canonical spec (10-phase plan, §8 immutable contracts).
- `docs/plans/2026-05-05-tabvision-spec-adoption-design.md` — adoption design
  (hybrid approach, phase mapping, sequencing, eval set strategy).
- `AUDIT.md` — Phase 0 audit: inventory, what works, reusable artifacts.
- `LICENSES.md` — dependency license map; ⚠️ items gate respective phase entry.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — non-obvious branches taken (per SPEC §0.5).

**Active branch (2026-05-13):** `main`. The Modal production deploy
(`936a5cc`) and v1 CI hardening landed on `main`; `refactor/v1` is now
**23 commits behind `main`** and should be treated as historical. Cut new
work branches off `main`. Older design docs (and earlier paragraphs in
this file) may reference paths that exist on `main` but not on
`refactor/v1` — verify with `git cat-file -e origin/main:<path>` before
relying on them. The full pipeline (`tabvision/tabvision/pipeline.py`),
the Modal production adapter (`tabvision-server/modal_app.py`,
`tabvision-server/app/v1_adapter.py`), and the highres audio backend all
live on `main`. Phase 5 fusion has shipped. See
`docs/2026-05-12-session-handoff.md` for the production state and
`docs/plans/2026-05-12-tab-f1-to-spec-design.md` (+ companion Phase 0
implementation plan) for current accuracy work.

## Operating rules (per SPEC §0)

1. **Audit before refactor.** Phase 0 audit (`AUDIT.md`) is non-negotiable.
2. **One phase at a time.** Phase N+1 starts only after Phase N's acceptance
   gate (SPEC §9.3) passes AND user says "proceed."
3. **§8 contracts are immutable** within a phase. Implementations may change;
   signatures may not, except by explicit user approval and a SPEC update.
4. **Tests over commits.** Every phase ships with new tests. A phase is
   "done" when its acceptance criterion is met on the eval set.
5. **Track decisions.** Append to `docs/DECISIONS.md` per the format there.
6. **Free tools first.** Pretrained > fine-tuning > training from scratch.
   Local > Colab > Kaggle. CPU-runnable > GPU-required.
7. **Flag, don't hallucinate.** Borderline metrics → low-confidence flag in
   the result, not a guess.
8. **Stop and ask** when the spec is ambiguous, when a phase test fails in a
   way the decision tree doesn't cover, or when an action would add a
   dependency / training run that costs money.

## v1 dev commands

```bash
# Install (dev)
cd tabvision
pip install -e '.[dev]'

# Run tests
pytest -v

# Lint + types
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
mypy tabvision

# CLI (Phase 0 stub)
tabvision --version
```

## v0 (frozen) reference

The v0 backend at `tabvision-server/` is preserved as a working desktop demo
and as porting source for Phases 1, 4, 5. Do not develop new features in
v0; reference its modules during port work:

| v0 module | v1 destination |
|---|---|
| `tabvision-server/app/audio_pipeline.py` | `tabvision.audio.basicpitch` (Phase 1) |
| `tabvision-server/app/video_pipeline.py` | `tabvision.video.hand.mediapipe_backend` (Phase 4) |
| `tabvision-server/app/fretboard_detection.py` | `tabvision.video.fretboard.geometric` (Phase 3) |
| `tabvision-server/app/fusion_engine.py` | `tabvision.fusion.{viterbi,playability,chord}` (Phase 5) |
| `tabvision-server/app/guitar_mapping.py` | `tabvision.fusion.candidates` (Phase 5) |
| `tabvision-server/app/chord_shapes.py` | `tabvision.fusion.chord` (Phase 5) |

If v0 needs to stay runnable for the demo:

```bash
cd tabvision-server
source venv/bin/activate
python run.py    # Flask dev server, port 5000
pytest tests/    # 17 v0 tests
```

## Acceptance targets (SPEC §1.4)

**v1 scope (2026-06-02): acoustic.** v1 targets the highest *acoustic* tiers
(single-line 0.94, strummed 0.86) + aggregate Tab F1 ≥ 0.88 and onset/pitch/
chord/latency — over GuitarSet. **Electric tiers are deferred to v2**
(evidence-based: clean-electric measured **0.12** — the backbone is
acoustic-trained and there's no in-repo training code; see
`docs/EVAL_REPORTS/cross_dataset_prior_2026-06-02.md`). v1 ships the **tone
toggle**: electric routes to a separate `highres-electric` checkpoint (a v2
deliverable), acoustic untouched. **SPEC §1.4 + §1.4.1 are the single source
of truth**; don't change scope/targets without a SPEC edit + user approval.

| Metric | Target | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| Onset F1 (50 ms) | ≥ 0.92 | mir_eval onset_f_measure |
| Pitch F1 (50 ms, no offset) | ≥ 0.90 | mir_eval note_f_measure |
| Tab F1 (string + fret + onset) | ≥ 0.88 | TP iff string + fret + onset all match |
| Chord-instance accuracy | ≥ 0.85 | Full fingering set per chord |
| End-to-end latency for 60 s clip on laptop CPU | ≤ 5 min | Wall-clock |

Per-tier (clean acoustic single-line / strummed / clean electric / distorted
electric): see SPEC §1.4 table.

## Glossary (selective)

- **§8 contracts** — the dataclasses and protocols in `SPEC.md` §8, mirrored
  in `tabvision/tabvision/types.py`. Immutable within v1.
- **Phase** — a section of SPEC §7. Each has Goal / Deliverables / Acceptance
  test / Decision tree.
- **Port** — wrap existing v0 logic to fit a §8 contract (Phases 1, 4, 5
  per design doc §3).
- **Build** — net-new work (Phases 0, 1.5, 2, 6, 9 per design doc §3).
